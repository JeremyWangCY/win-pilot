  content: `# Win-Pilot computer use

Use the \`computer\` tool for Windows apps and PC-Pilot-owned Chromium sessions. Preserve the current target and act from observed state; do not invent element ids, coordinates, tab ids, URLs, or success.

## Runtime boundary
- Work inside the user's current interactive Windows session. The user may continue working normally while PC-Pilot prefers background-safe browser/UIA/window-message paths.
- Do not assume or propose a VM, second desktop, or hidden alternate session as part of PC-Pilot's execution model.
- A desktop app that genuinely requires real foreground input cannot be guaranteed independent from the user's keyboard/mouse. Report \`background_unavailable\` accurately instead of stacking speculative background clicks.
- Treat capture and input as separate capabilities. A valid WGC/PrintWindow frame is evidence that the window can be observed while covered; it is not evidence that background keyboard/mouse delivery is supported.

## Keep the target stable
- Reuse the returned \`window\` or \`browser: { endpoint, tab_id }\` target object. The legacy \`browser_endpoint\` / \`tab_id\` fields remain valid. Recover in place before opening or launching a replacement.
- Desktop input is background-first. Use foreground interaction only when the background path is unavailable and the user explicitly asked for foreground control.

## Observe only when needed
- \`get_window_state\` is screenshot-first. Add \`include_text: true\` only when you need indexed UIA elements, document text, or \`accessibility_status\`.
- An \`element_index\` is valid only with the \`snapshot_id\` from the same state. Browser element tokens and short \`@eN\` refs are valid only for their current tab/document; stale refs are rejected.
- Reuse a returned \`post_action_observation\` when it already contains the evidence needed for the next decision. Do not call \`get_window_state\`, \`browser_state\`, or \`browser_observe\` merely because an action occurred.
- Refresh state when a snapshot/token is stale, the tool returns \`needs_observation\` or \`unknown\`, the target changed, or the next action needs information the current result does not contain.

## Act and verify
- Prefer semantic element actions over coordinates. If coordinates are necessary, use the current screenshot and include \`expected_name\` when available.
- Use \`expect\` when there is a concrete success condition. For a short predictable \`actions\` sequence, a step may also use \`when\` as a pre-dispatch gate; default to an immediate check and add a bounded timeout only when waiting is useful. Use this to remove obvious round-trips, not to encode brittle branching workflows.
- Treat an \`unknown\` mutation outcome as uncertain and inspect the same target; do not repeat the mutation automatically.
- On stale state, loading, timeout, or \`background_unavailable\`, take the narrowest evidence-backed recovery on the current target rather than restarting the app/browser.

## Browser tasks
- Reuse the exact \`browser: { endpoint, tab_id }\` target returned by PC-Pilot (legacy \`browser_endpoint\` / \`tab_id\` remain compatible). Prefer compact \`browser_observe\` for model-facing semantic state: it returns short \`@eN\` refs without raw UUID token noise. \`browser_state\` preserves both refs and raw tokens for compatibility. Observe when needed, not as a mandatory extra step after every action.
- For file inputs, \`browser_upload\` only selects explicit absolute file paths on an observed \`@eN\`/token and verifies the selection. It does not choose local files or submit the surrounding form for the agent.
- For canvas or other non-semantic targets, request \`browser_observe { with_screenshot: true }\` and bind \`browser_click_point\` to that exact \`screenshot_id\`. A changed tab/document/URL or stale screenshot is rejected.
- If an action already verifies its result, continue from that result. If it reports \`needs_observation\`, refresh that same tab before trusting the changed field or page.

## Finish
Preserve the user's existing windows and tabs. Close only temporary resources created for the task, after the requested result is established.`,
